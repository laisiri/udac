Function(MDN)
The procesure to qualify as function,it should take some input and return and output
where there is some obvious relationship between the input and output. To use a 
function,you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

Function declaration
A function definition(also called a function declaration,or function statement)
consists of the function keyword, follow by:
    
    The name of the function
    A list of parameters to the function,endclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
    The Javascript statments that define the function,enclosed in curly brackets{...}

Example

function square(number) {

    return number * number;

}
The function square takes one parameter,called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter
of the function (that is,number)multiplied by itself.
The statement return specifies the value returned by the function.
Primitive parameter (such as a number) are passed to functions by value,the value is passed to function,but if the function changes the value of the parameter,
this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function

if you pass an object as parameter and the function changes the object's properties,that change is visble outside the function,as shown in the following example.

function myFunc(theObject) {
    theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}

var mycar = {make: 'Honda',model: 'Accod', year: 1998};
var x,y;

x = mycar.make; //x gets the value "Honda"

myFunc(myFunc);
y = myFunc.make;//y gets the value "Toyota"

                //(the make property was changed by the function)

Function expressions
While the function declaration above is syntactically above 
is syntactically a statement,functions can also be created by a function expression.
Such a function can be anonymous,it does not have to have a name.
For example,the function square could have been defined as:

const factorial = function fac(n) { return n < 2 ? 1 : n * fac(n-1)}
console.log(factorial(3));

Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function. The following example
shows a map function that should receive a function as first argument and an array as second argument.
